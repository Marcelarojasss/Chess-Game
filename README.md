<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üß† About My Project

[![Marcela's chess board][product-screenshot]


Here's How It Works:
* Initialization (initializeBoard): The initializeBoard function initializes the chessboard with the starting positions of chess pieces.
  White pieces are represented by uppercase letters ('P' for pawn, 'R' for rook, 'N' for knight, 'B' for bishop, 'Q' for queen, and 'K' for king).
  Black pieces are represented by lowercase letters (same piece types).
* Printing the Chessboard (printBoard): The printBoard function prints the current state of the chessboard to the console.
The board is displayed with ranks (rows) labeled 8 to 1 and files (columns) labeled a to h.
Pieces are displayed using their corresponding letters, and empty squares are represented by '.'.
* Input Processing (movePiece): The movePiece function processes a player's move input. The input is expected in the format "e2 e4," representing a move from square e2 to square e4.
The function converts file and rank characters to corresponding indices on the chessboard and updates the board accordingly.
* Main Game Loop (main): The main function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the chessboard, enters a loop, and repeatedly prints the board, prompts the user for a move, and updates the board based on the provided move.
The loop continues indefinitely, and there is currently no implementation for game end conditions or player turns.
* User Interaction: The program uses std::getline to read the user's input for moves.
It checks whether the input format is valid before processing the move.
